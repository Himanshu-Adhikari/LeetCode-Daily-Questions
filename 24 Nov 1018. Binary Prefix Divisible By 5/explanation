Q:
You are given a binary array nums (0-indexed).
We define xi as the number whose binary representation is the subarray nums[0..i] (from most-significant-bit to least-significant-bit).
For example, if nums = [1,0,1], then x0 = 1, x1 = 2, and x2 = 5.
Return an array of booleans answer where answer[i] is true if xi is divisible by 5.

Ans:
Just do brute force like convert running number into decimal and check%5
or you can do divisibility check of binary numbers if want to hit the keyboard more.

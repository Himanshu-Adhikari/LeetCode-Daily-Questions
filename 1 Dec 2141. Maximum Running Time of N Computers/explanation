Q: 
You have n computers. You are given the integer n and a 0-indexed integer array batteries where the ith battery can run a computer for batteries[i] minutes. You are interested in running all n computers simultaneously using the given batteries.

Initially, you can insert at most one battery into each computer. After that and at any integer time moment, you can remove a battery from a computer and insert another battery any number of times. The inserted battery can be a totally new battery or a battery from another computer. You may assume that the removing and inserting processes take no time.

Note that the batteries cannot be recharged.

Return the maximum number of minutes you can run all the n computers simultaneously.


Ans:
So simple just do BS on answers this is what i thought there could be other methods as well.
So sort batteries in decending orders so that for n computers you assign the most charged batteries onlyyy and the rest other m-n (m size of batteries array) will act as a reserve battery that would take place in place of normal first n battery when that gets discharged .

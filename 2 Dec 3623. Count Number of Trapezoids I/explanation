Q:
You are given a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents the coordinates of the ith point on the Cartesian plane.
A horizontal trapezoid is a convex quadrilateral with at least one pair of horizontal sides (i.e. parallel to the x-axis). Two lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
Return the number of unique horizontal trapezoids that can be formed by choosing any four distinct points from points.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Ans:
We will go along the y axis maintaining how many pairs of points we had earlier multiply with 
current yth position every y axis point if have n points in it it will give around ncr(n,2) no. of points which 
will act as one side of trapezoid so we can say these are just n*(n-1)/2 contribution 
just in case u use python remember to use // division cause i forgot and 1e9+7 is not same as 10**9+7 also.

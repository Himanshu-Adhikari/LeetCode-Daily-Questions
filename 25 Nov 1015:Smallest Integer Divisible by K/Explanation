Q:
Given a positive integer k, you need to find the length of the smallest positive integer n such that n is divisible by k, and n only contains the digit 1.
Return the length of n. If there is no such n, return -1.
Note: n may not fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

Ans:
Just keep track of rem with K and as every divisibility follows a circle
so just track if at any point rem is already seen than return -1 .
